## 📌 Overview
A self-balancing two-wheeled robot with a reaction wheel for enhanced stability. Built using Arduino Uno, MPU6050, L298N, and custom mechanical design. This was my BSc final project in Mechatronics.  
Additionally, the robot has image processing abilities via Python and OpenCV which gives it the capabilities to analyze it path and move in a safe way. 

## 🧠 Features
- Reaction wheel for vertical stabilization
- PID control loop for balance
- MPU6050 IMU for tilt estimation
- Custom-built chassis and mass damper system
- Image processing for movement abilities

## 🔧 Hardware
- Arduino Uno R3
- MPU6050 (IMU)
- L298N H-Bridge
- JGB37-520 DC motors
- Reaction wheel
- Custom 3D printed parts
- Laptop Camera

## 🧠 Control
Implemented a PID controller in Arduino for stabilization. MATLAB was used for simulation and tuning.
