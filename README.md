## 📌 Overview
A self-balancing two-wheeled robot with a reaction wheel for enhanced stability. Built using Arduino Uno, MPU6050, L298N, and custom mechanical design. This was my BSc final project in Mechatronics.
Additionally, the robot has image-processing abilities which gives it the capabilities to analyze it path and move in a safe way. 

## 🧠 Features
- Reaction wheel for vertical stabilization
- PID control loop for balance
- MPU6050 IMU for tilt estimation
- Custom-built chassis and mass damper system
- Image processing for movement abilities

## 🔧 Hardware
- Arduino Uno R3
- MPU6050 (IMU)
- L298N H-Bridge
- JGB37-520 DC motors
- Reaction wheel
- Custom 3D printed parts
- Laptop Camera

## 🧠 Control
Implemented a PID controller in Arduino for stabilization. MATLAB was used for simulation and tuning.
